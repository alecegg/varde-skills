# review — recipes

Curated procedures for this skill's common operations, using plain shell
commands and direct file reads/writes — no external tool server is required.

## Route changed files before category review

```bash
git diff --name-only <base>...HEAD
```

Fall back to `git diff --name-only HEAD -- <section>` when scoping to one
section. Read the resulting file list and use judgment (or a subagent) to
split it into files that must be reviewed vs. files that can be skipped
(e.g. generated files, lockfiles, vendored code) before spawning category
agents — pass only the must-review files into each category pass.

## Analyze changed code

See the `## Analyze the changed code` section of `references/WORKFLOW.md`.

## Creating the review folder — direct markdown authoring

See the `## Create the review folder` section of `references/WORKFLOW.md` and
the `## Review folder layout` section of `references/FORMAT.md`.

## Writing findings — direct markdown authoring

See the `## Review each (section, category) pair` section of
`references/WORKFLOW.md` and the `## Finding format` section of
`references/FORMAT.md`.

## Searching project knowledge before each finding

See step 7 of the `## Review each (section, category) pair` section of
`references/WORKFLOW.md`.
