# Optional varde-docs CLI

`varde-docs` is a standalone, pre-alpha Rust CLI installed on PATH as
`varde-docs` (CLI-only — no MCP server surface). It's a generic
markdown-with-frontmatter store: concept CRUD, optimistic-concurrency
(compare-and-swap) writes, Personal/Project vault layering, ranked full-text
search, and an opt-in lint. It's optional: use it when available for
conflict-safe writes and ranked search, and fall back to plain
Read/Write/Edit/Grep/Glob when it isn't. Check once per session whether it's
installed:

```bash
command -v varde-docs >/dev/null 2>&1
```

If `varde-docs` is not installed, ignore this file and use plain
Read/Write/Edit/Grep/Glob for the same operations. Do not build or install it,
and don't treat its absence as an error.

## Vocabulary map

The CLI's OKF vocabulary maps onto the artifacts these skills already manage:

- **Concept** = one markdown file with YAML frontmatter (a knowledge note, a
  plan doc, any `<slug>.md`).
- **Slug** = the file's bundle-root-relative path, `/`-separated, `.md`
  stripped, kebab-case segments. A nested file
  `memory-bank/knowledge/pattern/code-review.md` under bundle root
  `memory-bank/knowledge/` has slug `pattern/code-review`.
- **Bundle** = a directory tree of concept `.md` files, passed as
  `--bundle <dir>`. Walks recurse at any depth.
- **Vault** = the Personal (`~/.varde-docs/`) vs Project (a repo bundle)
  layering that `list`/`search`/`lint` merge by default (Project wins on a
  same-slug collision); `--vault personal|project` narrows to one side.

## Command surface

```bash
varde-docs concept create   --bundle <dir> <slug>            # body from stdin
varde-docs concept create   --bundle <dir> <slug> --file <path>
varde-docs concept show     --bundle <dir> <slug> [--frontmatter-only] [--json]
varde-docs concept update   --bundle <dir> <slug> --expected-version <hash> [--file <path>] [--json]
varde-docs concept set-field --bundle <dir> <slug> <key> <value> --expected-version <hash> [--json]
varde-docs concept delete   --bundle <dir> <slug> [--json]
varde-docs concept list     [--bundle <dir>] [--vault personal|project] [--include-deprecated] [--json]
varde-docs concept search   [--field key=value]... [--text <query>] [--limit <n>] [--bundle <dir>] [--vault personal|project] [--json]
varde-docs lint             [--bundle <dir>] [--vault personal|project] [--okf] [--json]
```

`search` composes two modes: `--field key=value` (repeatable, exact
frontmatter AND-match) narrows first, then `--text <query>` ranks the
remainder with lexical full-text search over bodies and frontmatter values
(`--limit` caps results). `lint` runs spec-agnostic structural checks by
default; `--okf` adds OKF v0.2 checks. Neither lint mode ever blocks a write.

## Output and exit codes

With `--json`, a successful command prints its result JSON straight to stdout
(e.g. `show --json` prints `{"slug","version","frontmatter","body","created","updated"}`)
— there is no `{"ok":...}` wrapper. A failure prints `{"error": "..."}` and
sets a distinct **exit code**, so branch on `$?`, not on message text:

- `0` — success (stdout is the result)
- `1` — infrastructure/parse failure
- `2` — not found
- `3` — OCC version conflict (`--expected-version` is stale)
- `4` — invalid input (bad slug, validation failure)
- `5` — already exists (`create` only)

## The OCC read-then-write contract

Writes (`update`, `set-field`) require `--expected-version`, the version hash
last read via `show`, and reject a stale write instead of silently
overwriting. Always:

1. `show --bundle <dir> <slug> --json` → read the current `version`.
2. Compute the new content, then `update`/`set-field` with
   `--expected-version <that hash>`.
3. On **exit 3** (conflict) someone else wrote in between — re-`show`,
   reconcile against the new content, and retry. Never pass a guessed or
   reused hash.

This is the main reason to prefer the CLI when it's available: it makes
concurrent writers (a live agent and a user editing the same doc) safe.

## Fallback rule

If any `varde-docs` call fails for any reason, fall back immediately to
Read/Write/Edit/Grep for that one operation — don't block on it or try to
build/install it yourself. Absence of the binary is not an error.
## Storing the plan doc

When `varde-docs` is present, the living plan doc is a concept in a bundle
rooted at the plan directory, so every growth-loop write is OCC-safe. This
matters most in **in-doc collaboration mode** (below), where the user and an
agent may write the same doc: the version hash prevents a clobber.

```bash
BUNDLE=<plan-dir>          # the directory that holds plan.md
SLUG=plan                  # plan.md → slug "plan"

# Step 3 (create + seed): create the doc from the seeded draft.
varde-docs concept create --bundle "$BUNDLE" "$SLUG" --file "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/plan-seed.md"

# Step 4 (grow, each turn): show → read its "version" → edit → update with that
# hash. On exit 3, re-show and fold the user's concurrent edit in before retrying.
varde-docs concept show --bundle "$BUNDLE" "$SLUG" --json   # note the "version" value
varde-docs concept update --bundle "$BUNDLE" "$SLUG" --expected-version <version> --file "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/plan-next.md"
```

Fall back to plain Read/Write/Edit on any failure. Task files
(`tasks/<id>.md`, step 5) are ordinary files authored the same way as today —
they don't need the CLI, though `create` works for them too.

## In-doc collaboration mode (docwatch)

`docwatch` (a sibling CLI in the same repo, optional, macOS/launchd) lets the
user steer the plan by editing the doc from anywhere (e.g. iOS over
Tailscale): a line `@c: <steer>` in the doc dispatches an agent that runs one
growth turn and writes the answer back in place. This is the same "user edits
`plan.md` between turns" channel the skill already uses (step 4), made
agent-responsive without a live session.

Set it up early, in step 3, when the user wants this mode:

```bash
docwatch add <plan-dir>        # register the folder; starts a watcher
docwatch list --json           # confirm it's watching
```

Seed the doc's top with a trigger contract so a dispatched agent adopts this
skill's stance rather than docwatch's generic "answer inline" prompt:

```markdown
<!-- docwatch: on an `@c:`/`@cx:` trigger, load /varde-plan and treat the
     trigger text as one growth-loop turn on this doc. Grow the doc, route
     unknowns to ## Open Questions / ## Assumptions, write the result in
     place. Do not create or edit any other file. -->
```

Two boundaries make this safe and coherent:

- **Path.** docwatch watches a persistent folder, so in this mode the doc
  lives at its **stable plan path** for the whole growth phase — not inside a
  throwaway worktree (see step 2). The user must be able to reach the same
  path the agent writes.
- **Phase.** docwatch reverts any write outside the triggering doc, so it fits
  **only the growth phase** (single living `plan.md`). Task authoring (step 5)
  writes `tasks/*.md` — multiple files — and must run in a normal session,
  outside docwatch. Stop in-doc mode before authoring; `docwatch remove
  <plan-dir>` once the plan is done if the folder shouldn't stay watched.

If either tool is absent, plan exactly as today: grow via live chat, isolate
the whole run in a worktree (step 2), no in-doc triggers.
