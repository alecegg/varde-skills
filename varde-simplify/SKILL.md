  TRIGGER: Apply a lightweight, diff-scoped clarity pass to recently changed
  code — tighten naming, remove redundancy, and fix inconsistencies within
  the changed lines only, then verify with tests. The task-level companion
  to the full /varde-review skill; has no findings store and edits inline.
  SKIP: Skip when the user wants a structured multi-category review with
  persisted findings (use /varde-review), or wants to apply findings from an
  existing review (use /varde-review-fix).
  Example phrases: "simplify what I just changed" or "clean up this diff".

## Entry point dispatch

| Invocation | Action |
|---|---|
| *(none)* | Diff scope = uncommitted changes (working tree + staged) against `HEAD`. |
| `--staged` | Diff scope = staged changes only. |
| `--ref=<ref>` | Diff scope = changes against `<ref>` instead of `HEAD`. |
| `<path> [<path> ...]` | Diff scope = the named files, still line-ranged against `HEAD` (or `--ref`). |

## Workflow

1. **Load the references.** Load `references/SCOPE.md` for how changed-line
   ranges are computed and merged from `git diff`. Load
   `references/PRINCIPLES.md` for the simplification principles that govern
   every edit this skill makes. Check once per session whether the
   `varde-code` CLI (an optional tool, installed on PATH) is available: run `command -v varde-code >/dev/null 2>&1`.
   If present, load `references/VARDE-CODE-CLI.md` for optional
   diff-scoped symbol lookups that can replace some of step 5's context
   reads. If it isn't, ignore that file and use the plain Read workflow
   as-is.
2. **Isolate if invoked standalone.** If this run was dispatched directly by
   a user or top-level agent (not already running inside a caller's own
   isolated worktree, e.g. `build`'s per-task loop or `review-fix`'s
   dirty-tree isolation), invoke the `varde-worktree` skill: `create
   id=simplify-<short-id>`, run every step below with the printed `path=`
   as the effective repo root, then `merge id=simplify-<short-id>` and
   `cleanup id=simplify-<short-id>` once the pass reports back — this keeps
   a concurrent agent's edits elsewhere in the repo from colliding with this
   pass's own commits. Skip this step entirely when already running inside
   a caller-provided isolated worktree; isolating twice is redundant.
3. **Compute scope.** Derive the changed-file list and line ranges (or
   whole-file for newly added files) per `references/SCOPE.md`. If no
   changes are found, report that and stop — never invent scope.
4. **State the plan.** Report the resolved diff source (working tree /
   staged / `--ref`) and the file list with their line ranges before editing
   anything.
5. **Apply edits.** One file at a time, per `references/PRINCIPLES.md`. Read
   surrounding code for context only — never edit outside a file's listed
   ranges. Newly added files may be edited in full.
6. **Verify.** Run the project's existing test command after each file's
   edits — when `varde-code` is available, use `tests_for_file` to scope this
   to the tests actually covering the edited file instead of the whole
   suite where the project's test runner supports targeting individual
   files; fall back to the full command otherwise. A failing run reverts
   that file's edits (`git checkout -- <path>` for a tracked file, or
   discard the edit for a new file) before moving to the next file — never
   leave the tree worse than before the pass started. A green run only proves
   behavior-preservation if the tests actually exercise the edited lines — if
   the edited lines have no covering test, say so in the report rather than
   treating the green run as proof.
7. **Report.** A short summary: files touched, what changed and why, and any
   worthwhile improvement that fell outside scope (name it, don't apply it).
8. **Reflect and consolidate.** Invoke `varde-reflect source=varde-simplify` — it
   captures friction scoped to this skill's own execution and harvests any durable
   knowledge the work produced (no handoff mid-session). If `varde-reflect` isn't
   installed, fall back to `varde-friction` with the same scope.

## Gotchas

- Never change behavior — this is a clarity/consistency pass only, not a
  feature or logic change. All existing tests must continue to pass.
- Never expand scope to unchanged lines, even when a fix would clearly be
  better there — name it in the summary instead of applying it. Auditing
  unchanged code is where false findings breed; the diff scope is the
  discipline that keeps this pass cheap and trustworthy.
- Newly added files are in scope in full; files with deletions-only hunks
  have nothing to simplify — skip them.
- This skill has no findings store and no review folder — it edits inline
  and reports a summary directly to its caller. Use `/varde-review` when
  persisted, triaged findings are needed instead; use `/varde-review-fix` to apply
  an existing review's findings.
- When invoked from `build`'s task-level loop or `review-fix`'s dirty-tree
  isolation, this pass runs inside the caller's own isolated worktree and
  writes nothing outside it — no shared plan-directory artifacts,
  consistent with how those callers already isolate task-level work from
  plan-level or review-level aggregation. Step 2's own isolation is only for
  a standalone invocation with no such caller.
