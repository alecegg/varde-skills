## Storing the plan doc

When `varde-docs` is present, the living plan doc is a concept in a bundle
rooted at the plan directory, so every growth-loop write is OCC-safe. This
matters most in **in-doc collaboration mode** (below), where the user and an
agent may write the same doc: the version hash prevents a clobber.

```bash
BUNDLE=<plan-dir>          # the directory that holds plan.md
SLUG=plan                  # plan.md → slug "plan"

# Step 3 (create + seed): create the doc from the seeded draft.
varde-docs concept create --bundle "$BUNDLE" "$SLUG" --file "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/plan-seed.md"

# Step 4 (grow, each turn): show → read its "version" → edit → update with that
# hash. On exit 3, re-show and fold the user's concurrent edit in before retrying.
varde-docs concept show --bundle "$BUNDLE" "$SLUG" --json   # note the "version" value
varde-docs concept update --bundle "$BUNDLE" "$SLUG" --expected-version <version> --file "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/plan-next.md"
```

Fall back to plain Read/Write/Edit on any failure. Task files
(`tasks/<id>.md`, step 5) are ordinary files authored the same way as today —
they don't need the CLI, though `create` works for them too.

## In-doc collaboration mode (docwatch)

`docwatch` (a sibling CLI in the same repo, optional, macOS/launchd) lets the
user steer the plan by editing the doc from anywhere (e.g. iOS over
Tailscale): a line `@c: <steer>` in the doc dispatches an agent that runs one
growth turn and writes the answer back in place. This is the same "user edits
`plan.md` between turns" channel the skill already uses (step 4), made
agent-responsive without a live session.

Set it up early, in step 3, when the user wants this mode:

```bash
docwatch add <plan-dir>        # register the folder; starts a watcher
docwatch list --json           # confirm it's watching
```

Seed the doc's top with a trigger contract so a dispatched agent adopts this
skill's stance rather than docwatch's generic "answer inline" prompt:

```markdown
<!-- docwatch: on an `@c:`/`@cx:` trigger, load /varde-plan and treat the
     trigger text as one growth-loop turn on this doc. Grow the doc, route
     unknowns to ## Open Questions / ## Assumptions, write the result in
     place. Do not create or edit any other file. -->
```

Two boundaries make this safe and coherent:

- **Path.** docwatch watches a persistent folder, so in this mode the doc
  lives at its **stable plan path** for the whole growth phase — not inside a
  throwaway worktree (see step 2). The user must be able to reach the same
  path the agent writes.
- **Phase.** docwatch reverts any write outside the triggering doc, so it fits
  **only the growth phase** (single living `plan.md`). Task authoring (step 5)
  writes `tasks/*.md` — multiple files — and must run in a normal session,
  outside docwatch. Stop in-doc mode before authoring; `docwatch remove
  <plan-dir>` once the plan is done if the folder shouldn't stay watched.

If either tool is absent, plan exactly as today: grow via live chat, isolate
the whole run in a worktree (step 2), no in-doc triggers.
