## Phase 3: Propose edits for all docs

Spawn one agent per document. Each agent:

1. Reads the full document content.
2. Identifies the most relevant source(s): use the marker's mapping if present;
   otherwise match by domain name (e.g. `planning-and-build.md` → the
   plan/build subsystem, `architecture.md` → the architecture layer, `review.md`
   → the review subsystem) and locate the corresponding source files or specs.
3. Reads those source(s) in full.
4. Compares all hand-authored content (any section without a spec-declared marker
   block) against the source facts. Flags divergences: stale paths, removed or
   renamed skills or operations, contradicted invariants, missing concepts present
   in the source.
5. Produces a list of proposed changes: `{ section, current_text, proposed_text,
   rationale }`. If no divergences are found, reports "no changes proposed" for that
   doc.
6. For unmarked docs: also proposes a freshness marker (format:
   `references/MARKER-FORMAT.md`) identifying the source(s) that should track this
   doc going forward.

Present all proposals grouped by document. For each proposed change, show the
current text, the proposed replacement, and the rationale. The user approves or
skips each one.

Apply approved proposals by editing each doc in place. For each unmarked doc where the user approved
at least one change, prepend the proposed freshness marker as the first line of the
file.
