# Automated fix pass

## Dirty-tree isolation (standalone invocation only)

If step 2 of `SKILL.md` found a dirty `repoRoot` on a standalone
invocation and the user accepted isolation, invoke the `varde-worktree` skill:
`create id=review-fix-<review_dir>` (base = current branch), run every step
below with the printed `path=` as the effective `repoRoot`, then
`merge id=review-fix-<review_dir>` followed by `cleanup id=review-fix-<review_dir>`
once the merge lands cleanly. If the merge reports a conflict, follow the
`varde-worktree` skill's `references/RESOLVE.md` with intent "apply review
findings from `<review_dir>`" — do not clean up the worktree until that
resolves.

Process findings in category and file order. In default mode, process only
`Label: auto-fix` findings. In `mode=build`, process every finding regardless
of label.

For each finding:

1. Load the complete finding block.
2. Verify every location exists and still matches the recorded location.
3. Ask a fresh subagent to select the highest-confidence solution.
4. In `mode=build`, run the escalation gate (below) against the selected
   solution. If it trips, do not apply — relabel the finding `triage` if it
   was `auto-fix`, leave `Disposition: blank`, record the reason, and move on
   to the next finding.
5. Run `git stash -u` before applying the selected solution.
6. Apply only the selected solution.
7. Run the type checker and tests scoped to the finding's own `location`
   package/file (e.g. `npx tsc --noEmit -p <package>` or `npm test --
   <affected-test-path>`), not the whole-repo command, unless the finding's
   fix touches files outside a single package — only then fall back to the
   full-repo `npx tsc --noEmit` / `npm test`. This finding was already
   verified once by the task subagent that authored it; a scoped rerun here
   confirms the fix without re-paying a second full-suite pass per finding.
8. Load the source task referenced by the finding's `location` field. If it
   has an optional `#### Verification` subsection with `assert:` lines, run
   every assertion and require all to pass. If the subsection is absent, skip
   this check.
9. On verification failure, run `git stash pop` and leave the disposition
   blank.
10. On success, run `git stash drop`, set `Disposition: fix`, and record the
    verification result.

Never mark a finding fixed before verification passes. Process later findings
after a failure. Report each result with its identifier and category.

A green scoped run in step 7 proves the fix introduced no regression; it does
**not** by itself prove the reported defect is gone. Before setting
`Disposition: fix`, confirm the finding's own defect no longer reproduces:

- Prefer a check that would have failed *before* the fix — an existing test
  that exercises the defect, or the finding's task `assert:` lines (step 8). A
  test that passes both before and after the fix is circular for this finding
  and proves nothing about it.
- If nothing exercises the defect, confirm resolution by re-reading the fixed
  code path against the finding's `Summary`, and record that the defect was
  confirmed resolved by inspection rather than by a failing-then-passing test —
  so the closing summary does not overstate the evidence.

## Escalation gate (`mode=build`)

Checked in step 4 of the automated fix pass, using the caller's
`plan_context` (plan goal, plan-level acceptance criteria, `creates`/`modifies`
scope). Before applying a solution, check both:

- **Spec conflict** — would the fix require the code to stop satisfying a
  plan-level acceptance criterion, or contradict something the plan explicitly
  specifies?
- **Scope creep** — would the fix change or break functionality outside the
  task's `creates`/`modifies` files, or introduce behavior the plan does not
  call for?

If either is true, the gate trips: skip application and hand the finding to
the human triage pass instead. Add a bold `**Escalated:**` field to the
finding, right after `Location`, with value `spec-conflict — <why>` or
`scope-creep — <why>` so the human pass can show it without re-deriving it.

If neither is true, apply and verify as normal — this covers most findings in
`mode=build`, including ones labeled `triage` by the review.
